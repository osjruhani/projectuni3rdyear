For the registration form to work properly we need to create a database in my phpmyadmin where,
servername = "localhost"
username = "root"
password = ""
database = "ruhani"

then create a table named "registation" in the "ruhani" database with 6 rows with the setting as shown in "database.png" image of root root directory
